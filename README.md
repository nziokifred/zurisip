Fruit Juice Company Website Project
Project Overview

This project is part of the Web Development for Everybody course offered by the University of Michigan.
As a requirement for the course, I am building a website using HTML and hosting it on GitHub so that I can share it with my peers for review and feedback.
Although this is an academic assignment, this project goes beyond grading. I am developing this website as the foundation for my own fruit juice processing company. My intention is to continue improving and refining it until it becomes the official website for my business.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:

Practice and strengthen my foundational web development skills
Apply HTML concepts learned in the course
Begin building a professional online presence for my business
Develop a website that enhances brand positioning and credibility
This project represents the first step toward creating a strong and competitive digital presence for my company.

About the Business

The business focuses on producing high-quality fruit juices, including flavors such as:
Mango
Passion
Tropical blends
The goal is to position the brand as both premium and accessible, offering quality, freshness, and trust to consumers.

Technologies Used

At this stage, the project is built using:
HTML (Introduction to HTML module)
Future modules will introduce additional technologies to improve structure, design, responsiveness, and functionality.
Future Improvements

As I progress through the course and continue practicing, I plan to:

Improve website structure and layout
Enhance user experience
Add styling with CSS
Introduce interactivity
Optimize responsiveness for different devices
This repository will evolve as my skills grow.

Collaboration & Feedback

I welcome constructive feedback from peers, collaborators, and anyone interested in helping refine this project.
Suggestions on structure, clarity, branding, and overall presentation are highly appreciated. My goal is to build a website that gives my business a strong edge in brand positioning and credibility.
